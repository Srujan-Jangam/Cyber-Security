## Incident Title

Authentication Failure Detected on Local System

## Summary

Multiple failed login attempts were observed on the system after intentionally entering incorrect passwords. These events were recorded in system authentication logs, confirming that failed login activity is properly captured and available for investigation.

---

## Log Sources

- `journalctl` (system-wide log aggregation) 
- `lightdm` logs (GUI authentication manager)

---

## Event Description

The failed authentication events occurred when incorrect credentials were entered during the login process. Log entries indicated authentication failure messages generated by the login service.

---

## Analysis

**What happened:**  
Failed login attempts were recorded by the system.

**Was it malicious?**  
No — activity was intentionally generated for testing purposes.

**What would make this suspicious in a real environment?**

- High number of failures in a short time

- Attempts from unknown IP addresses
 
- Repeated failures targeting one account
 
- Failures followed by a successful login 

---

## Risk Assessment

⚪ **Low Risk** — This was controlled test activity.

👉 In a production environment, similar patterns could indicate:

- Brute force attack
 
- Credential stuffing

- Unauthorized access attempts
 

---

## Recommended Actions (Real SOC Scenario)

If this were not a test:

- Monitor login attempts

- Identify the source of requests
 
- Temporarily lock the targeted account

- Block suspicious IP addresses

- Escalate if attempts continue

## Key Learning

Authentication logs are critical for detecting unauthorized access attempts. Reviewing multiple log sources helps confirm events and improves investigation accuracy.
