## WHAT
Log files store events, processes, and messages generated by operating systems, applications, and services. They help track user activity, system behavior, and errors.
 
## WHY IT MATTERS
Logs are primary evidence for detecting security incidents such as brute force attacks, unauthorized access, privilege abuse, and malware activity.

## LOG SOURCES / DATA SOURCES
- /var/log/
- journalctl
- lightdm logs (GUI authentication)

## KEY LINUX LOG FILES
- /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages – General system activity
- /var/log/auth.log or /var/log/secure – Authentication events
- /var/log/boot.log – Boot messages
- /var/log/faillog, btmp – Failed login attempts
- /var/log/wtmp, utmp, lastlog – Login history
- /var/log/httpd/ – Web server access and error logs
- /var/log/mysql.log – Database activity
- /var/log/kern – Kernel logs

## NORMAL BEHAVIOR
- Occasional failed login attempts
- Regular service start/stop messages
- Scheduled cron jobs

## SUSPICIOUS PATTERNS
- Multiple failed logins in short time
- Repeated failures for same user
- Login attempts at unusual hours
- Privileged actions after failures

## INVESTIGATION FLOW
1. Identify authentication failures
2. Check frequency and source
3. Look for successful login after failures
4. Decide whether to escalate

## COMMANDS / QUICK REFERENCE
- less {logfile} 
- grep "Failed" {logfile}
- journalctl -n 50
- journalctl | grep -i fail
- tail -f {logfile}

## MINI INVESTIGATION / EXAMPLE
Failed login attempts were generated intentionally using incorrect passwords. Events were observed in both journalctl and lightdm logs, confirming authentication failures were logged correctly.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS
- Same event can appear in multiple logs
- Correlation improves confidence
- Logs are noisy — filtering is essential
